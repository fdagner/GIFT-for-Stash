# GIFT-for-Stash
Uses the GIFT format to generate random Stash questions for the Moodle quiz

Copy your stash secrets into the provided fields and choose the options for generating the quiz code.
Optionally, you can upload your secrets from a file (with weights).
In case you want to provide more than one object (a collection), use the 'Anzahl der Objekte pro Option' setting.
If you want you can choose the text for the options in the question and for the pick up message for a Stash object.

In case you have the Generico-Plugin installed in your Moodle, the template will generate a table with all Stash secrets.
Just add this code to anywhere in a text field in your Moodle: {GENERICO:type="stash"}

You can either copy your secrets into a text editor or just use the generated file "GIFTforStash.txt" and import the file into the Moodle question bank through the GIFT format option.
